# Convex Hull

The Jarvis algorithm is one way to solve the convex hull problem. I propose a
formal specification of the problem and an implementation of this algorithm in
the WhyML language with the aim to prove its correctness and termination.

Project of the course of proofs of programs [2.36](https://marche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/lecture-deductive-verif/) from MPRI.

For more informations, the reader may look at my [report](./report.pdf)
and the [subject](./enonce.pdf) of the project.
